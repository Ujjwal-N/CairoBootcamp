### Question
What do you understand by
1. O(n)
2. O(1)
3. O(log n)

### Answer
These are all time complexities. O(n) is linear, O(1) is constant and O(log n). A time complexity means that the function being modeled has a run time closest to the above functions.

## 3

### Question
Which of those is best when describing a proof size

### Answer
With regards to space complexity, a good proof should be O(log n) so that it can compactly prove the execution of a certain program given a certain input size. An incredibly compact proof would have a time complexity of O(1), where the proof is completely independent of the input size. 

## 4

### Question
In your teams, discuss why are there few identity projects on Starknet?

## Answer
Likely because proving identity in a zero-knowledge manner is difficult since zero-knowledge involves hiding information and identity is all about revealing information.
