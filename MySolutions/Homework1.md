# Homework 1

## 1 

### Question
Working with the following sets of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

What is
a) 4 + 5
b) 3 x 5

### Answer

a) (4 + 5) (mod 9) = 9 (mod 9) = 0 (mod 9)
b) (3 x 5) (mod 9) = 9 (mod 9) = 15 (mod 9) = 6 (mod 9)

## 2

### Question
For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

a) Can we consider 'S' and the operation multiplication to be a group?
b) Can we consider 'S' and the operation division to be a group?

### Answer
a) No, only 3 out of 4 conditions are met:

1. Closure: for every element, a * b is in G
2. Associativity: integer multiplication is associative
3. Identity element: 1 is the identity under multiplication
4. Inverse: 3 does not have inverse when performing multiplication

b) No, condition 1 is not satisfied:

1. Closure: any element divided by 0 is undefined, which is not an element of S
